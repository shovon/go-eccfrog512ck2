// Package ecc provides helpers for utilizing the EccFrog512ck2 elliptic curve
// parameters, specifically for elliptic curve cryptography using the curve.
//
// In this package you will find the "private key" type, which is pretty much
// a "big integer" primitive, used in cryptography, since cryptography with
// computers involves extremely large numbers.
